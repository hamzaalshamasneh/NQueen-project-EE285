%% MN_next Function (Hamza Alshamasneh)
% The function's job is to place N queens on an NxN chessboard, starting from
% an initial position inputed by the user. And then placing the rest of the queens by
% searching safe rows and columns, and calling an external function (queenElim)
% to update the board by removing all threatened squares.

%% Initail Version:
% by using a loop and linear indexing, it searched for the next valid square
% by sorting the valid indices and choosing the next one after the current.
% was missing earlier valid squares.

%% Update #1:
% switched to using nested loops to search from top left of the board.
% also rebuilt the board at each iteration and applied the elimination
% function for all previously placed queens. Skipped the used rows and
% columns.

%% Upadate #2 (Final Update):
% used new internal function (bestPlacement) to find the best queen
% positions through a structured board checking, then updates the board
% state after each move.



function [finalBoard, queenPositions] = MN_next(startCoord, queenNum)
% MN_next begins with a user inputed queen placed at a starting coordinate on an NxN chessboard.
%then tries to add as many additional queens as possible without any of them threatening each other.
%threats are eliminated using (queenElim) function.
